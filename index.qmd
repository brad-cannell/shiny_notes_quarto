# Welcome {-}

Welcome to Brad Cannell's Shiny Notes!

This is a [Quarto Book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) version Brad Cannell's Shiny Notes. I'm really making this book for myself, but even better if you find it useful too!

Why am I doing this (as opposed to just keeping notes locally)?     

* Better organized (e.g., chapter structure and search)      
* Easy access -- just click on the bookmark on web browser      
* Practice using Quarto
